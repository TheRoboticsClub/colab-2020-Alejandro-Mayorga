Hello, blog reader!

I'm Alejandro Mayorga, student of the [Robotics Engineering	 software at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/grado/3099-ingenieria-de-robotica-software).

I'm preparing for this new adventure where we will facing some of the JdeRobot proyects. The first of them will be the Visual Follow Line with a Formula 1. This will be a challenge that will grow progressively.

With the post that are published every week we will be telling you the advances, problems and solutions about the project and I hope it will be nice to read it and follow it.

Nothing would make me prouder than these post and the tutorials that are presented to help someone understand and learn the challenges of the projects presented here and I would be pleased to answer any of your questions.

Let the adventure begins!

Alejandro.
